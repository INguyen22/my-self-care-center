# Self Care Center
## Overview
How can I care for myself? One way is with affirmations and mantras!
Affirmations are thoughts of positive self-empowerment, meant to assert your self-worth.
Mantras are repetitive phrases that are repeated again and again during mindfulness practices. Your challenge is to build an app that helps users remind themselves of their inherent value!

This Solo Challenge gives students and instructors the opportunity to get a pulse on where you are with the foundational concepts of Module 1 curriculum. Students should use this as an opportunity to challenge themselves and work completely independently. Google can (and probably should!) be used, but any other code base should not be referenced. Instructors will be able to use your work, both completion of functionality and code quality, to determine where you stand and if you are behind for this point in the module, provide supports to intervene.

The spec for this project can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-1/self-care-center.html).

## Introduction
  - The purpose of this solo challenge was to allow students to practice some of the foundational concepts learned so far within the module by themselves. The main ones for this project were to make a mock up of a website using HTML and CSS while also making specific functions work, such as, a "receive message" button where users would either get an affirmation or a mantra depending on their selection using JavaScript.

## Technologies
  - Javascript
  - HTML
  - CSS

## Features
- Users are able to select which kind of message they want and receive a random message based on their selection.
- Users will be exposed to a new color scheme in the background depending on what message they wanted to receive
- The famous pink ball, Kirby, will appear when the user has selected a message.
- The website will adjust to mobile screens
- A loading animation will occur when the user clicks the receive message button.

## Deployed Page

## Possible Future Extensions
- Be able to save affirmations/mantras that the user likes and be able to view them on a separate section.
- Add sound to the webpage so when the user clicks on the receive message button they will hear a calming bell chime as their message appears.
